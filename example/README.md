1) youâ€™ll need these components:

The TeamID (also called AppID prefix). This will be in your App ID identifiers
The KeyID. This will be in the keys section when you download your private key
The ClientID. In Apple land, this is the Services ID
The Audience which will always be https://appleid.apple.com



2 ) When you download your key file (which you can only do once), it will download with .p8 extension. I rename this file to apple_private_key.pem.
